# FoodAdvisor
See it, track it, eat it !


FoodAdvisor is an application developed for the Google Technologies for Cloud and Web Development Workshop 2016/2017.
This app tracks food products by collecting detailed info on quality and by following the route from the producer to you.

What is traceability?
Traceability is about knowing where a food item is or has been at a particular moment and what has been done to it.
